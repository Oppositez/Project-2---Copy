        <h2 id="11">-What is "Aromanticism"?-</h2>
        <p id="1" class="lore">Aromanticism is a romantic orientation, which is characterized by 
            people who experience little to no romantic attraction to others.</p>
        <h2 id="22">-Isn't that the same thing as "Asexuality"?-</h2>
        <p id="2" class="lore" ><b>NO!!!</b> While Aromanticism is a romantic orientation, Asexuality
            is a sexual orientation. Also, you don't have to be both, a person can just be Asexual or 
            just be Aromantic.</p>
        <h2 id="33">-Can Aromantic people still date?-</h2>
        <p id="3" class="lore"><b>YES!!!</b> Even though they don't feel romantic attraction,
             some Aromantic folks may want to date while others don't. Plus some identies under the Aro spectrum 
             like Demi or Grayromantic are still able to feel romantic attraction in some situations.

    <div class="item">
        <h2 id="44">-What does an Aromantic relationship look like?-</h2>
        <p id="4" class="lore"> A relationship with an Aromantic person can look like many things
            and really relies on communication to make sure everything is going smoothly. Some Aros 
            may be ok doing traditionally romantic things like kissing in relationships while others just
            want to keep it platonic. Every relationship is different and depends on the person so there is
            no single way to define an Aronmantic relationship.
        </p>
        <h2 id="55">-Are Aromantic people queer?-</h2>
        <p id="5" class="lore"><b>YES!!!</b>Even though people belive it is not a queer identity because
            it doesn't mean a person is gay, Aromantic people still experience different attraction and experiences
            compared to heteronormativity.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
        <h2 id="66">-Is Aromanticism a mental issness?-</h2>
        <p id="6" class="lore"><b>NO!!!</b> Aromantic people don't have anything wrong with them medically
            that causes them to be Aro. They are just born like that and doesn't mean they are a 
            sociopath and are just as much human as everyone else.
        </p>
        <h2 id="77">-Why do we need Aro Awareness?-</h2>
        <p id="7" class="lore">Aromantic is commonly misconcepualized which leads to a lot of problems
            for us. Manly people in the queer community believe Aromanticism isn't 
            queer, causing people to think we're making this up for attention and be included in queer spaces.
            Since a lot of people also believe it's not possible for a person to feel no romantic attraction,
            Aromantic people are subjected to conversion therapy or are sexually assaulted as a way to try to "fix them".
